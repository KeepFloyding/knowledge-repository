# Data Set Generation

* [Canonical Variate Dissimilarity Analysis for Process Incipient Fault Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8304817)

Generation of a simplified CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor) model that creates a simulation based data set of normal operation and fault-induced anomalous operation. Model is subsequently used to test different multivariate statistical process monitoring methods. Model and paper results have been recreated here.

* [A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920410519306357?via%3Dihub)

This dataset contains several undesirable events related to subsea oil and gas production. It contains samples of real, simulated and sketched events from time series data that can be classified into 9 distinct categories (8 faulty and 1 normal). Additionally, the time series data within each event goes through 3 different phases and is correspondingly labeled as belonging to normal, transient or steady-state. 

* [Open Industrial Data: Inspiring Innovation & Fueling Collaboration in the Oil & Gas Ecosystem ](https://openindustrialdata.com/media/1065/open-industrial-data-cognite-akerbp.pdf)

Open Industrial Data is a data set that represents the first of four stages for compression of natural gas on the Valhall PH platform. The purpose of the gas train is to compress and treat the gas to meet the required export pressure and specification, with a total capacity of 4,06 MSm3/d (143 MMscf/d). The data set includes time series data, maintenance history, and Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) for Valhallâ€™s first stage compressor and associated process equipment. This includes process equipment such as the suction cooler, suction scrubber, compressor and discharge coolers.
