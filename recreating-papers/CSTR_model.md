## Introduction

The following paper has done the following:
* Created a CSTR model based on first-principle differential equations
* Solved this model for normal and anomalous operation. 
* Used the resulting data set as a means for testing fault detection methods. 

The model is freely available as a SIMULINK file but to be honest, outside of academia, this is not widely used. Our aim is to recreate this data set using the Julia 
SciOpt packages. You can see the methodology and results below:
